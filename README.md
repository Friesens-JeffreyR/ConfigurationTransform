Microsoft has a neat out of the box solution for Web Application Projects configuration transform which gives you the ability to have multiple configurations for each build environment (i.e. web.config). Somehow this ability is not included in other project types.

When you have multiple projects with many configurations the dev->staging->production task becomes very unpleasant. I remember back then having one app.config file with different commented configurations for each environment struggling to comment uncomment the right ones. Well I'm happy those days are over. After using app.config transformations for two years doing it the hard way by editing the project file and adding the configuration files manually, I thought it would be nice to write extension to automate this task.

There are many articles and solutions out there, some of them used as the inspiration for this extension.

When I developed this extension I had a few things in mind:

*   Multiple configuration files for different environments (e.g. dev/staging/production).
*   ClickOnce support.
*   Self-contained solution - no need to install the extension on all dev/ build server machines.
*   Simple   few clicks and you are set.

**GitHub Sample**

### Step by Step Instructions: ###

1. Add **App.config** file to project

2. Right click **App.config** file in solution explorer and select **_Add Config Transforms_**

   Notice that you have new App.$$$.config files under App.config

   corresponding to build configurations

3. Set the source **App.config**

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <configuration>
   <appSettings>
   <add key="Environment" value=""/>
   </appSettings>
   </configuration>
   ```

4. Set the target **App.Debug.config**

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!-- For more information on using app.config transformation visit    http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125889 -->
   <configuration xmlns:xdt="http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform">
    <appSettings>
     <add key="Environment" value="Debug" xdt:Transform="Replace" xdt:Locator="Match(key)"/>
    </appSettings>
   </configuration>
   ```

5. Build project.

### Linked Configs Step by Step Instructions: ###

1. Add link(Existing Item...) **App.config** file to project

2. Right click link **App.config** file in solution explorer and select **_Add Config Transforms_**

   ![](resources/package_preview.png)

   Click _**Yes**_ button, if you select _**No**_ button concrete(not linked) config files will be created which suits certain use case

   ![](resources/add_as_linked_config.png)

   Notice that you have new App.$$$.config files under App.config

   ![](resources/app_configs.png)

   corresponding to source App.config files

3. Continue with step 3 above...
